# PDFNano Future Enhancements

This document outlines planned enhancements to improve the PDFNano library functionality and handle more complex PDF features.

## Planned Enhancements

1. **✓ Real PDF Structure Parsing** [IMPLEMENTED]  
   Implement proper parsing of the XREF table, trailer, and object structure to access actual document objects.

2. **Content Stream Parsing** [PARTIALLY IMPLEMENTED]  
   Add real content stream parsing to extract actual text content with:
   - ✓ Text positioning (Tm, Td, TD operators) [IMPLEMENTED]
   - ✓ Font handling and text encoding [IMPLEMENTED]
   - ✓ Character spacing and word positioning [IMPLEMENTED]
   - ✓ Text state parameters (scaling, leading, rendering mode) [IMPLEMENTED]

3. **Image Extraction Improvements** [PARTIALLY IMPLEMENTED]  
   Enhance image extraction to properly handle various filter types:
   - Basic image extraction [IMPLEMENTED]
   - Complete ASCII85 decoder implementation [TODO]
   - LZW decoder implementation [TODO]
   - JBIG2 compression support [TODO]
   - CCITT Fax compression support [TODO]
   - Color space transformations (DeviceRGB, DeviceCMYK, ICC profiles) [TODO]
   - Image masks and soft masks [TODO]
   - Inline images [TODO]

4. **Document Structure Support** [TODO]  
   - Parse document outlines (bookmarks/table of contents)
   - Extract and process hyperlinks
   - Support for annotations (notes, highlights, etc.)
   - Form fields processing for interactive PDFs
   - Document attachments extraction

5. **Encrypted Document Handling** [TODO]  
   - Support for password-protected PDFs
   - Various encryption algorithms (RC4, AES)
   - Document permissions handling
   - Digital rights management (DRM) detection

6. **Font and Text Enhancement** [PARTIALLY IMPLEMENTED]  
   - ✓ Basic font dictionary parsing [IMPLEMENTED]
   - ✓ ToUnicode mapping for correct character extraction [IMPLEMENTED]
   - ✓ Custom encoding dictionaries [IMPLEMENTED]
   - Proper font subsetting support [TODO]
   - CID font handling [TODO]
   - Right-to-left text support [TODO]
   - Ligatures and special character handling [TODO]
   - Font metrics for text positioning [TODO]

7. **Performance Optimizations** [PARTIALLY IMPLEMENTED]  
   - ✓ Error recovery for damaged PDFs [IMPLEMENTED]
   - Stream processing for large documents [TODO]
   - Incremental parsing (parse only what's needed) [TODO]
   - Worker threads for parallel processing [TODO]
   - Memory usage optimization for large documents [TODO]
   - Caching strategies for repeated access [TODO]

8. **PDF/A and PDF/X Compliance** [TODO]  
   - Verification of document compliance with archival standards
   - Checking print production standards compliance
   - Validation of document metadata for archival purposes

9. **Digital Signatures** [TODO]  
   - Verification of digitally signed documents
   - Validation of signature integrity
   - Certificate chain verification
   - Timestamp verification

10. **Error Recovery** [PARTIALLY IMPLEMENTED]  
    - ✓ Graceful handling of malformed PDFs [IMPLEMENTED]
    - ✓ Recovery strategies for common structural errors [IMPLEMENTED]
    - Repair options for damaged documents [TODO]
    - Detailed error reporting [TODO]

## Current Status

The library currently has a working implementation of:
- PDF structure parsing (XREF tables, trailer, object references) with robust error recovery
- PDF object model (dictionaries, arrays, strings, numbers, streams)
- Stream decoding (primarily FlateDecode/zlib compression)
- Metadata extraction (title, author, creation date, etc.)
- Advanced text extraction with proper positioning and font support
- Basic image extraction (primarily for common formats like JPEG and PNG)

The main focus for the next development phase should be:
1. Improving image extraction by adding support for more filter types
2. Implementing document structure features like outlines and hyperlinks
3. Adding support for encrypted documents
